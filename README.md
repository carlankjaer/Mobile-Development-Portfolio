## Hello! I am a software developer, specializing in app development in Flutter and Swift.<br/> Here are some examples of what I have been working on in my spare time:

# PsoCare

This app was designed and developed for my Master's Thesis in collaboration with psoriasis patients. PsoCare is an app created to help people suffering from psoriasis to manage their disease better by keeping track of their symptoms. This app is still under development and will become available in both App Store and Play Store.
